# Chocolatine
The project was to learn how to make Github Actions, it was the project of Initiation to DevOps (that I like)

## How does it works
You need to put the file chocolatine.yml at the location .github/workflows/ for the file to work when you push or merged on the project.

## What does he needs
The project work with a C program with unit-tests, he need a Makefile, you need to put the link with the mirror repo and the binary name in the file chocolatine.yml and you need to put in the Github secret a SSH key.
